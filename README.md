Step 1: 
Please write a MIPS program to prompt the user to input three integer numbers L,  M and N (all > 20) from the console. Then check whether the input numbers L,  M and N are legal or not. If L, M or N is 0 or negative number or any positive number less than or equal to 20, it is regarded as illegal and your program should display an error message saying "Illegal Number!" and prompt the user to input another integer number again. Keep doing this until the user input three legal numbers L,  M and N (i.e., all should be positive integers > 20). 
Step 2:
With the legal numbers L,  M and N above from Step 1, please print the Greatest Common Divisor of L,  M and N. After that please run your MIPS program using SPIM software to display the result in the output (console) window. Please make sure your program is complete and runs correctly under SPIM software.
